🚀 App Developer | Creative Problem Solver | Tech Tinkerer

I build unique, idea-first apps that blend functionality with creativity — from sarcastic AI bots to smart decision-makers. I experiment with AI integration, custom algorithms, and user-first UX, often coding from scratch without relying on heavy libraries. Whether it's browser-based games, clever utilities, or real-time experiences, I focus on pushing boundaries with fast prototypes and hands-on logic. I love turning impossible-sounding concepts into working projects, especially with a touch of humor or unexpected utility.

💡 Passionate about learning by building.
🛠️ JavaScript, Python, Streamlit, Node.js, HTML/CSS, Groq API, and wild imagination.
